#-- Objects

p:f0 is a file.

#-- Init

p:f0's name is "world.mp4". p:f0 is read. p:f0 has p:s00 which is a
video stream. p:s00 is encoded by Libx264. p:f0 has p:s01 which is an audio
stream. p:s01 is encoded by Aac.

#-- Goal

p:f1 is a file. p:f1's name is "hello.mkv". The file has an audio stream which
is encoded by Opus. p:s10 is the stream. The file has a video stream which is
encoded by Libx265. p:s11 is the stream. The file is written.

#-- Theorems

# There is a name of a file which has an audio.
# An written file's stream is encoded by a codec.

#-- Querries
