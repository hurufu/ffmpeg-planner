#-- Axioms

Every audio stream is a binary stream, and every video stream is a binary
stream. Libx265 is a video codec, and Libx264 is a video codec. Aac is an audio
codec, and Opus is an audio codec. If a file is read from Disc then the file
isn't written to Disc. No audio stream is a video stream. No audio codec is a
video codec. No video stream is encoded by an audio codec. No audio stream is
encoded by a video codec.

#-- Objects

p:f0 is a file.

#-- Init

p:f0's name is "world.mp4". p:f0 is read from Disc. p:f0 has p:s00 which is a
video stream encoded by Libx264. p:f0 has p:s01 which is an audio stream
encoded by Aac.

#-- Goal

There is a file which has a name which is "hello.mkv", and the file has an
audio stream which is encoded by Opus, and the file has a video stream which is
encoded by Libx265. The file is written to Disc.

#-- Theorems

# There is a name of a file which has an audio.
# An written file's stream is encoded by a codec.

#-- Querries

# Does a file that has a name which is "hello.mkv" have a video?
# How many streams does a written file have?
# What is a read file?
# Is there a written file?
# Does a written file have a stream?
# Does a written file have a name?
