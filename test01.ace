#-- Axioms
Every audio is a binary stream, and every video is a binary stream.
Libx265 is a video codec, and Libx264 is a video codec.
Aac is an audio codec, and Opus is an audio codec.

#-- Objects

p:f0 is a file.

#-- Init

p:f0's name is "world.mp4".
p:f0 is read from a disk.
p:f0 has p:s00 which is a video encoded by Libx264.
p:f0 has p:s01 which is an audio encoded by Aac.

#-- Goal

There is a file which has a name which is "hello.mkv", and the file has an
audio which is encoded by Opus, and the file has a video which is encoded by
Libx265. The file is written to a disk.

#-- Tests

#There is a name of a file which has an audio.
#Does a file that has a name which is "hello.mkv" have a video?
#How many streams does a written file have?
#An written file's stream is encoded by a codec.
